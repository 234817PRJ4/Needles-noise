          <ul>
            <li>
              A <strong>colour scheme (</strong>with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website) <em> see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #272727;"></span>
              #272727<em>&nbsp;The off-black colour refers to Black is the main colour of hard rock. It represents darkness, mystery, death and is also the main colour of tattoos. It's edgy and keeps the tone of voice of the brand. </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #595959;"></span>
              #595959
              <em>Dark grey gives variety and depth without making the brand colourful. Hard rock culture usually lacks variety of colours and sticks to grayscale.  </em>
            </li>
			  <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #b21f24;"></span>
                #b21f24
                <em>Dark red is a strong accent to bring the website colour without straying away from the hard rock aesthetic. Dark red symbolizes passion and desire, it also suggests mystery and suspense. s&hellip;</em>
            </li>
			  <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #f5f6f6;"></span>
                #f5f6f6
                <em>Off-white gives the website a professional look while not bothering the hard rock aesthetic. Creates visual balance and keeping the site from feeling too heavy.</em>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong></li>
            <li>RUBIK DIRT:&nbsp;This font has a distressed aesthetic, that has the gritty, raw vibe of hard rock. The static-like texture gives a feeling of chaos, noise, and rebellion – all core elements of the genre. It also looks like something off a vintage rock gig poster.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Road Rage looks handcrafted and chaotic. It's full of personality and energy. The brush stroke texture gives it a rebellious, expressive tone, giving it the DIY punk and garage rock influences often found in hard rock.</li>
            <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong> </li>
            <li><em>1:</em> <strong>Grids</strong> – Grids provide structure that scales across devices, maintaining a consistent layout with responsive design</li>
            <li><em>2&nbsp;</em>:<strong>Cards</strong> – Cards help structure information into scannable units, supporting the focus on clarity and content prioritization. They follow repetitive conventions, allowing users to quickly recognize content structures and interact with them. Our cards have buttons attached to it, t giveour users a clear CTA where to go to.</li>
            <li><em>3&nbsp;</em>:&nbsp;<strong>Accordions</strong> - Accordions allow to surface relevant content progressively, reducing overwhelm and supporting a clean, minimal interface design. Navigation and content &nbsp;</li>
<li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong>&nbsp;- <strong>Navigation bar –</strong> We tried to keep our navigation bar as clear and organised as possible. We used <strong>red</strong> for the buttons to draw attention to the different options. The navigation bar being dark grey keeps it in line with the brand aesthetic.</li>
            <li>With only three main pages (<strong>Home</strong>, <strong>Catalogue</strong>, <strong>About Us</strong>) we are embracing a lean information architecture. This keeps the user focused, reduces decision fatigue, and matches the bold, no-nonsense tone of rock culture. The Home page gets users into the feel and vibe of the brand and presents the main information about its purpose. Catalogue serves as the functional part of the website where users can browse and contact artists. Splitting 'About Us' into Events, Team, FAQ, and Contact reduces cognitive overload and keeps information structured. This supports the flow, and respect for user attention which is important when dealing with a target audience that is bold and expressive</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>? The gritty visuals and font styles reflect a consistant tone of voice, raw, authentic and expressive. This makes our branding cohesive across visual and written content. Also our <em>buttons</em> are a straight CTA for our user, clear and simple. Attracting the visitor and guiding them without cluttering the brands aesthetic lean content architecture having only three core pages align with the "cut the crap marketing" strategy we have.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>? Our value lies in being a hub for hard rock inspired tattoo artists and fans,the the website showcases that through:<strong> Catalogue focused UX:&nbsp; </strong>The card based layout and minimal navigation prioritise the artist discovery and collaboration process, supporting our unique offering of creative connection.</li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Introduction</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Hello there! We are Needles &amp; Noise. Our work is shaped by sound, stories, and the edge where art meets identity. This report dives into the heart of our latest marketing campaign, built to resonate with hard rock fans who live loud and wear their stories on their skin. At our core, it’s all about authenticity — no trends, no posers, just raw, unapologetic self-expression. This is more than tattooing; it’s a community where every line tells a legend.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Campaign</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The aim of our campaign is to increase awareness of our brand and the services we offer. We also put a lot of emphasis on engagement, which is why the content we provide is designed for this purpose. </p>
          <p><strong>Target audience</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;Our target group are people between the ages of 18 to 35 years old, that are metal and hard rock fans based in Noord-Brabant. Either have tattoos or are planning to get tattoos. They purchase from small businesses and want to support small artists. They rarely use TikTok and mostly use Instagram. to follow artists and festivals. They engage with carousel posts, reels and stories especially with concert clips and tattoos. They search for inspiration for tattoos on Pinterest. They regularly visit hard-rock festivals and concerts. Our target audience tends to interact with brands and artists that are grounded in authenticity and community. They value creators who are passionate and original and have their own way of expressing their character through their designs. They prefer content that feels real and authentic over precisely prepared advertising. Strong engagement is often seen with relatable content. They share or repost when they feel connected to a message. Mostly if it supports underground culture. Our target audience thrives on visual content, videos, photos, reels. They are drawn to storytelling around the artist and their art; healed tattoos, gothic linework, blackwork, progress shots of tattooing. The best time to reach them are evenings on weekdays and late mornings and nights during the weekend. </p>
          <p><strong>Objectives</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The objective set for the marketing campaign of Needles &amp; Noise are as followed:&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Reach objective</strong>: By 30th of April 2025 we aim to reach 500 users on Instagram who like hard rock music and have interest in tattoos&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Affect Objective</strong>: To inspire and excite our users to get a new tattoo through hard-rock specific content .This will be measured by increased interactions (including likes, follows, and other forms of engagement), with the goal of achieving a total of 250 interactions across all posts by April 30th, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Response Objective</strong>: By April 30th, 2025, we aim to gain 30 followers and generate 10 clicks, guiding users to our website where they can connect with tattoo artists and explore rock-inspired tattoo ideas.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that it will only have results for the first 4 weeks, we decided on setting small goals as our niche is quite small and we wanted to set something that was achievable yet could give us an overview. Also since it was a first time we wanted to keep the goals as realistic as possible.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Channels</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For the channels we decide on using Instagram, Instagram is one of the most used social media platforms in the Netherlands as almost 59% of Dutch people use Instagram (Statista, 2025). Not only this but with our target audience of 18-35 years olds have the highest distribution which account to a combined 51.1% as of January of 2025(Statista, 2025). More specifically for Rock Fans according to our interviews which insight can be found here (link of interview insight) it was commonly agreed that they all use Instagram as a platform. This can confirm that instagram will be where we can target and reach our audience the best making it the ideal channel.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram also supports our communication goals;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our reach objective, Instagram's algorithm and the discovery features (such as reels and hashtags) help us to reach users from a starting account. Especially since hashtags can reach those who's interested is both hard rock and tattoos. (Demeku, 2025)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our effect objective, since Instagram is very visual it allows for us to create engaging post that can follow the rock aesthetics, helping us align and create excitement and inspiration on using our platform to get a new tattoo.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our response objective, Instagram allows for links to be added in our bio since we decide on using link tree it allows for the users to click our link in bio.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram allows also for a mix of different content which we can then use to support our strategy&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;In Week 1, we focused on introducing our platform and explaining what Needles &amp; Noise is about. At this stage, our Linktree was not yet set up, which explains why link clicks remained at zero. We only shared static posts this week, with no additional content formats. While there were no major surprises, we were impressed by the number of profile visits, which suggested that people were curious and interested, even if they didn’t engage through likes. We also tried experimenting with posting times and hashtags when in this week we decided on more niche hashtags. This insight encouraged us to think about how we could make our content more engaging and action-oriented in the following weeks. </p>

          <p>In Week 2, we introduced reels into our content strategy, which significantly boosted our performance. The inclusion of reels led to a noticeable increase in both reach and profile visits, with our account reaching over 400 users and generating 131 profile visits. This week also marked our first link clicks, showing progress toward our response objective. The positive impact of reels became clear, and we decided to prioritize them more in future weeks. Additionally, we surpassed our initial reach objective by the end of this week, demonstrating early momentum in our campaign.One reason why is because we started mixing broad and specific hashtags to target the right audience. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;In Week 3, we built on the strategy from Week 2 by continuing to focus on reels, with 3 out of 4 posts being video content. This approach helped us reach 222 more accounts compared to the previous week. However, despite the higher reach, we saw a noticeable drop in profile visits and accounts engaged, which suggests that while more people saw our content, fewer were motivated to take further action. We observed a slight increase in content interactions, which may be linked to our shift toward funny and relatable content. This type of content seemed to resonate more with the audience on a surface level, sparking more engagement with the posts themselves. We also experimented with call-to-action strategies, such as encouraging users to click our link, but this only resulted in one click during the week. Additionally, we began testing different posting times and noticed that a post shared at 1 PM performed better in terms of engagement, a helpful insight for future scheduling. </p>

          <p>&nbsp;In Week 4, we shifted toward more informational carousel posts, while still including one reel with a humorous tone to maintain variety. Although we posted slightly less than in previous weeks, we saw a significant increase in link clicks, reaching a total of 5. This improvement likely came from clearly directing users to our Linktree in the captions and aligning all content with that goal. Interestingly, our text-based, informative posts appeared to drive more website traffic, even if they were slightly less visually engaging. Our intent this week was to clearly explain what our platform offers, even if it meant sacrificing a bit of entertainment value. We also experimented with a “Fact or Myth” post to encourage comments and discussion. However, it received no comments, highlighting a continued challenge with generating deeper engagement. Despite that, we hit 63 followers by the end of the campaign more than double our original target in the response objective, which was a major success. While we achieved a high reach early on, we fell short of meeting our affect and response objectives. This highlighted that while reaching users wasn’t an issue, generating the desired level of engagement and action was. We ended up with 149 interactions and 8 link clicks, which was just shy of our goals. However, we don’t consider the campaign a failure. Building a brand in such a short time is challenging and from these small setbacks from our goals we look to improve and refine our strategy moving forward. </p>
          <p><strong>Takebacks&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>During these 4 weeks, there was a lot of experimenting with different hashtags, post times, and types of posts. What I learned was that a mix of broad and niche-specific hashtags works best for reaching a wider audience. In Week 2, after we tried this approach, we saw a significant increase in reach, with no post reaching fewer than 400 views. We also learned the importance of posting times. While our initial insights suggested otherwise, we found that posting during the day—particularly around lunchtime—led to higher views and likes. After doing some research, we discovered that people often check Instagram during lunch breaks, which could explain this trend (Mathur, 2025).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp; Another key takeaway was that funny posts performed best. Although we used templates that may not have resonated with rock fans, the engagement indicated otherwise. On the flip side, posts that encouraged interaction, like asking people to leave comments, performed poorly. This could be because we didn’t have a strong follower base that consistently engaged, which made these posts underperform. We also noticed that posts with only one photo, as opposed to carousels, lacked engagement, likely because they were plain and didn’t offer enough value. Reels, of course, were the content that achieved the best results, likely due to their higher chances of appearing on the Explore page. Additionally, using popular audio tracks helped our reels get more exposure. We had expected our educational posts about what our platform offers to perform better, as we felt our target audience would be more interested in understanding the value we provide, rather than just being shown something entertaining. However, we realized that our assumption was incorrect, and these posts didn’t perform as well as anticipated. We also had a post where we thought viewers would be excited to spotlight their work. Unfortunately, that post didn’t perform well, and it made us realize that the audience didn’t respond as we expected. One important lesson was the need to find better ways to direct users to our link. Since the link was mostly located at the bottom of posts with the "Click link in bio" call-to-action, people may have missed it or didn’t scroll down far enough. Moving forward, we’d experiment with making the link more prominent so that it stands out. </p>
          <p>If we could do things differently, we would implement reels earlier in the campaign. We feel that reels were an excellent tool for reach, and we could have adapted them more effectively to drive more link clicks. Maybe making these reels with popular videos in the niche of Rock Fans. Additionally, posting consistently during the 1-3 PM window, when we saw higher engagement, would be a priority. Lastly, in terms of the frequency of posts, we’d experiment with posting stories, especially if we manage to grow a larger follower base. Also posting consistently and not whenever we could maybe have reached us higher results which is something we would implement in the future. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the project were to continue, several changes would be made. The target audience would stay the same; however, we feel that conducting more research into the types of content they engage with most and how they use Instagram would help us better tailor our approach. More consistency in posting days would also be important, meaning that our communication and media calendar would need to be developed further. During the first 4 weeks, only 14 pieces of content were posted, which averages to about 3.5 posts per week. While this meets the minimum Instagram recommendation of 3–5 posts per week, the inconsistency—some weeks having more posts than others—could have negatively impacted engagement. Instagram also suggests posting one story per day, as stories help boost interaction (How Often You Should Post on Instagram in 2025, 2025). This is something the team didn't do, and in hindsight, it could have supported our engagement goals significantly. In addition to how much we posted, when we posted also played aA new communication plan has been created as an example of the different media types we should post,what times and dates which can be later used as inspiration or reference for the second part of the campaign (Insert link here)  role. According to research, the best days and times to post are Monday through Thursday from 10 AM to 3 PM—a timeframe we didn’t consistently follow (Keutelian, 2025). For future planning, aligning posts with these time slots could help us reach peak engagement.In terms of content itself, our funny posts performed best, so this style should definitely be carried forward. Creative content, such as behind-the-scenes with artists showing how they design tattoos, could also boost engagement. This would resonate well with rock fans, who often value authenticity and creativity (Statista, 2025). Another clear issue was our lack of comments and shares, which are key indicators of engagement. To encourage this, we suggest implementing Instagram-exclusive giveaways. For example, offering a chance to win a free tattoo session with one of our artists could create buzz and encourage followers to share the post—expanding our reach and interaction (Keefe, 2024).</p>
          <p>To evaluate whether these changes would be effective, new objectives should be set, building on what we've learned from this campaign. These recommendations are directly influenced by our past experience and are aimed at improving performance in future campaigns:</p>
          <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
          <p>Reach Objective: By the 31st of December 2025 we aim to reach 10,000 users who like hard rock and have an interest in tattoos&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Affect objective: To inspire and excite our users to get a new tattoo through hard-rock specific content .This will be measured by increased interactions (including likes, comment, and other forms of engagement), with the goal of achieving a total of 1,050 interactions across all posts by December 31st, 2025. </p>
          <p>Response Objective: By December 31st, 2025, we aim to gain 500 followers and generate 100 clicks, guiding users to our website where they can connect with tattoo artists and explore rock-inspired tattoo ideas.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Although the affect objective's main goal was not changed as it reflects what our brand wants to do however the number of interactions was modified to better align with projected outcomes based on content performance and realistic expectations drawn from the first part of the campaign. It’s important to note that if any of the objectives are reached before December 31st, 2025, setting new ones would be reasonable since these objectives are influenced by the insights gained from the initial 4 weeks. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>We tried as much as possible to stick to the brand image, colors, and fonts throughout the posts. Although there were some inconsistencies in the color scheme at the beginning, this was quickly resolved. The issue occurred due to a color setting mismatch—one person had their files set to RGB, while the rest of the posts used CMYK. Once we identified the problem, we corrected it to ensure brand consistency.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Another source of inconsistency came from our reels. As explained in our communication plan (insert link) , the reels were primarily designed for engagement purposes. Initially, we did not hide these reels from our main feed, which made our homepage appear visually inconsistent. This was especially noticeable because the reels featured figures like Kris Jenner, IShowSpeed, and Ross Geller—individuals who, we later realized, didn’t resonate with our target audience. It’s important to clarify, as also mentioned in our communication plan, that these reels were based on popular Instagram templates that we adapted to communicate our own message. The figures shown were not the focus of the content, which is why they were never mentioned in captions. However, since these reels were important for increasing engagement and reaching our reach objective, we chose to keep them—just not on the homepage. We moved them to the Reels tab instead, which allowed the main feed to look more visually cohesive and aligned with our brand identity. </p>
          <p>To stay responsive to trends, none of our posts or reels were created too far in advance. This flexibility allowed us to act quickly on any trending content that could increase reach. While we did face some inconsistency at times, we always made sure to either hide, correct, or adjust the visuals so that our overall look stayed on the right track.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As mentioned above regarding the use of well-known figures in certain templates, the same justification applies across our posts. These explanations focus on visual choices and captions (e.g., call-to-action strategy), while the hashtag decisions are addressed in the learning points section. </p>
