          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Introduction</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Hello there! We are Needles &amp; Noise. Our work is shaped by sound, stories, and the edge where art meets identity. This report dives into the heart of our latest marketing campaign, built to resonate with hard rock fans who live loud and wear their stories on their skin. At our core, it’s all about authenticity — no trends, no posers, just raw, unapologetic self-expression. This is more than tattooing; it’s a community where every line tells a legend.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Campaign</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The aim of our campaign is to increase awareness of our brand and the services we offer. We also put a lot of emphasis on engagement, which is why the content we provide is designed for this purpose. </p>
          <p><strong>Target audience</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;Our target group are people between the ages of 18 to 35 years old, that are metal and hard rock fans based in Noord-Brabant. Either have tattoos or are planning to get tattoos. They purchase from small businesses and want to support small artists. They rarely use TikTok and mostly use Instagram. to follow artists and festivals. They engage with carousel posts, reels and stories especially with concert clips and tattoos. They search for inspiration for tattoos on Pinterest. They regularly visit hard-rock festivals and concerts. Our target audience tends to interact with brands and artists that are grounded in authenticity and community. They value creators who are passionate and original and have their own way of expressing their character through their designs. They prefer content that feels real and authentic over precisely prepared advertising. Strong engagement is often seen with relatable content. They share or repost when they feel connected to a message. Mostly if it supports underground culture. Our target audience thrives on visual content, videos, photos, reels. They are drawn to storytelling around the artist and their art; healed tattoos, gothic linework, blackwork, progress shots of tattooing. The best time to reach them are evenings on weekdays and late mornings and nights during the weekend. </p>
          <p><strong>Objectives</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The objective set for the marketing campaign of Needles &amp; Noise are as followed:&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Reach objective</strong>: By 30th of April 2025 we aim to reach 500 users on Instagram who like hard rock music and have interest in tattoos&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Affect Objective</strong>: To inspire and excite our users to get a new tattoo through hard-rock specific content .This will be measured by increased interactions (including likes, follows, and other forms of engagement), with the goal of achieving a total of 250 interactions across all posts by April 30th, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Response Objective</strong>: By April 30th, 2025, we aim to gain 30 followers and generate 10 clicks, guiding users to our website where they can connect with tattoo artists and explore rock-inspired tattoo ideas.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that it will only have results for the first 4 weeks, we decided on setting small goals as our niche is quite small and we wanted to set something that was achievable yet could give us an overview. Also since it was a first time we wanted to keep the goals as realistic as possible.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Channels</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For the channels we decide on using Instagram, Instagram is one of the most used social media platforms in the Netherlands as almost 59% of Dutch people use Instagram (Statista, 2025). Not only this but with our target audience of 18-35 years olds have the highest distribution which account to a combined 51.1% as of January of 2025(Statista, 2025). More specifically for Rock Fans according to our interviews which insight can be found here (link of interview insight) it was commonly agreed that they all use Instagram as a platform. This can confirm that instagram will be where we can target and reach our audience the best making it the ideal channel.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram also supports our communication goals;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our reach objective, Instagram's algorithm and the discovery features (such as reels and hashtags) help us to reach users from a starting account. Especially since hashtags can reach those who's interested is both hard rock and tattoos. (Demeku, 2025)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our effect objective, since Instagram is very visual it allows for us to create engaging post that can follow the rock aesthetics, helping us align and create excitement and inspiration on using our platform to get a new tattoo.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- For our response objective, Instagram allows for links to be added in our bio since we decide on using link tree it allows for the users to click our link in bio.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Instagram allows also for a mix of different content which we can then use to support our strategy&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Reels can allow us to create more reach and attract new users through the explore page&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Image post and carousel can be used to spread information on our platform and the value it can bring to the audience&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Having this combination can allow for a consistent visual identity that will allow us to reach different types of engagement helping us reach our overall goals in our campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
